# JavaScript Learning Project

This repository is structured to help you learn JavaScript from basics to advanced concepts. Each section builds upon the previous one, providing a clear learning path.

## Project Structure

```
javascript-learning/
├── basics/
│   ├── fundamentals.js     # Core JavaScript concepts
│   └── functions.js        # Function types and usage
├── data-structures/
│   └── arrays-objects.js   # Data manipulation
├── browser/
│   └── dom-manipulation.js # Browser interactions
└── advanced/
    └── async-programming.js # Async operations
```

## How to Use

1. Start with files in the `basics` folder
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Uncomment the script you want to test in `index.html`
4. Use the browser's console (F12) to see output
5. The page will also display console output in a visible div

## Learning Path

1. **Basics**
   - Start with `fundamentals.js`
   - Move on to `functions.js`

2. **Data Structures**
   - Learn array methods and object manipulation

3. **Browser**
   - Practice DOM manipulation

4. **Advanced**
   - Study asynchronous programming

## Testing Your Code

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Uncomment the relevant script tag
3. Write your code in the corresponding .js file
4. See results in both the webpage and browser console

## Tips

- Always test one file at a time
- Use console.log() to debug
- Experiment by modifying the examples
- Check browser console for errors
